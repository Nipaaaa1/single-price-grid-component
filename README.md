## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework


### What I learned

In this challenge I learnt about Using Tailwind CLI instead of CDN. There's some configuration that I need to learn, but overall it's worth it. Smaller CSS, a **TON** of customizations and Tailwind Intellisense that helps me.

Also, I'm using prettier plugin which make the tailwind class sorted automatically. It's a bit nicer this way.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about customizing in Tailwind CSS. Maybe I could someday build a Design System in Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) - There's a color that didn't included in the style guide, so I use this to pick that color.
- [HSL to HEX Converter](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - As always, this helps me convert HSL from style guide to HEX so I could use it in Tailwind CSS.
